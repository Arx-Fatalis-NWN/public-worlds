Make sure that each collaborator, or pull-request is issued with the following naming extensions. Otherwise, the pull request will not be accepted, nor pushed to the collection of module updates.

DO not work on a module that is already been taken by a world builder. All pull requests in the latter will be denied by reviewers or project leads.
The only exception, is if the world builder designated is either inactive, ill, or has granted permission.

Legal ERF Naming:
USER-MOD

Naming is not allowed to exceed 16 Characters, and cannot use special characters. This is an engine limitation.

Example:
